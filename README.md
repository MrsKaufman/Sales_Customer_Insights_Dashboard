# 📊 Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This project explores a simulated e-commerce dataset to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. It demonstrates the full BI workflow: from data extraction and cleaning with SQL, to exploratory analysis in Python, to interactive visual storytelling using Tableau.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL:** Data extraction, cleaning, aggregation
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn):** EDA, KPI calculations, visual insights
- **Tableau:** Interactive dashboard with filters and KPI highlights

## Key Business Questions Answered
- What is our monthly revenue trend?
- Which products generate the most revenue?
- How do different regions perform?
- What is our average order value?
- What percentage of customers are repeat buyers?

## Deliverables
